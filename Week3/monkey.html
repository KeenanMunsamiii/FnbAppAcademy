                            <h3>MONKEYs</h3>

                        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the
                        group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; 
                        alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.</p>

                        <p>In 1812, Ã‰tienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys" 
                        ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).[3][4][5] The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).[
                        </p>


                        <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly 
                        active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.</p>

                        <p>You will find the monkey at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
